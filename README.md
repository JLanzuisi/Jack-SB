# Swimming backwards

This repo holds the Markdown, TeX, and any other, files required to 
typeset the book with LaTeX or pandoc, for a pdf or an epub, 
respectively.

## Getting the book

"Final" versions of the pdf and epub can be found in the releases.

Non-release versions are in the `out` directory.

## Structure

The chapters are in markdown files.

The `Main.tex` file is the main file for the pdf and the one targeted 
by `latexmk`. The `out` directory contains the output of running 
LaTeX, including the pdf file, and also the output of pandoc (the 
epub).

The `preamble.tex` file holds the TeX preamble: packages, classes, 
custom command, etc. The book uses the KOMA-Script book class.

The draft files, provided by the author, are in the draft folder.

Epub specific files `epub-*` are used by pandoc to style the epub, add 
metadata, etc.

## Building

The building process is based on a Makefile, this means that the 
`make` program needs to be available. For the details, look at the 
Makefile.

If you want to make both the epub and the PDF run `make both`.

### Epub

The epub is produced from the markdown files using `pandoc`.

To make the epub, type `make epub`.

### PDF

The build process relies on `latexmk` and luaLaTeX. A TeX distribution 
(MikTeX and TeXlive were tested here) is required, of course, as are all the packages 
invoked by `\usepackage`.

The book's typefaces are those in the Reforma family by Pampatype. 
They're free to download and use.

To make the pdf, run `make` or `make pdf`.
