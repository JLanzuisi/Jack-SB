## Joanna Turnus

If my two brothers had lived, would my mother have played with them on
the beach, building sandcastles, happily answering questions, playing
with their trucks, wearing a baseball hat backwards, oblivious to
anything else? Would she have respected who they were? Would she have
created a world for them with no uncertainty, no ambiguity, a black and
white world with no grey; mother and sons happy and content with each
other? Or, would she have over-masculinized them, forcing each to become
someone else, reduced to an elusive stereotype? Or perhaps, satiated
with boys, she would have craved a girl, dressing the youngest (or
perhaps the oldest, or both) in girls' clothes and girls' underwear? I
shuddered at the thought. Maybe it was better that both my brothers had
died?
