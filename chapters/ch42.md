Despite my misgivings, despite every internal alarm bell going off,
Sunday mid-morning I found myself getting ready for a high-noon cruise
on Boston harbor. Don't ask why. One of the great unsolvable mysteries
of our time, that Einstein himself couldn't have solved even if he lived
to be 100.

I had no idea if this cruise was formal or informal, and no idea what to
wear, and since I've never been on one before, I called my sisters for
advice. 'Cruise casual' was the consensus, 'you can't go wrong.'

Since it was too hot for anything but shorts, and autumn ruled out
anything but brown, I decided on a brown casual jacket with olive green
shorts, and a white T-shirt. If it was informal, I could roll up my
sleeves, untuck my shirt and wrap the jacket around my waist, and if
formal I'd keep the long-sleeves and tuck in my shirt. Either way, I
decided on shorts: who'd be looking at my legs?

At the last moment I dashed on a little Armani, which I hadn't worn in a
long time.
