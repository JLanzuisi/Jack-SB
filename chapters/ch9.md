Sometimes I tried reading with my mother, wondering if her morning
readings could ever calm me, perhaps even bring us closer. But she
always read coldly, methodically, fogged in by an elusive serenity,
fumbling her cross necklace, staring past me as if veiled, her face
obscured---and in a way I wished it were, for at least she would have
appeared more consoling and more humane.

One morning I asked my mother for readings for a confused and depressed
eighth-grade girl---not confused over which lip gloss to wear, what
skirt to wear with what blouse, what not to say to a boy she liked---but
confused over her own identity, not knowing if she was a boy or a girl,
not knowing who she was or who she was supposed to be, or even who she
wanted to be. My mother exploded. I was used to my father hitting me but
not my mother, although her cold, callous looks were far worse.

That was the last time I sat with her.
