The next morning the drywall guys joined us for coffee, looking like
vampires with their pasty-white skin. Paul was unusually talkative,
chatting as if they were long-lost friends: "I was half-way up the
ladder, when this big bastard demands that I come down immediately."

"You? On the ladder?" I asked. "Actually working?"

"A much-needed break." said Abe.

"He probably had no idea who you were, that you even worked here," added
Nick, lighting a cigarette.

 "Who'd you piss off now?" asked Gary. "The Carpenters' BA?"

 "Our guys use more sophisticated tactics," Nick said, exhaling smoke
 in my face. "Like

cutting your ladder in half with a Skil-Saw."

 "He was from the mafia," Paul replied, "asking me to work for him."

 "You?" I asked, joining the laughter. "In the mafia?"

 "They must be really scraping the bottom of the barrel," said Abe.

 "In a year I'd triple my salary," said Paul. "Although I'd have to
 start at the

bottom."

 "And end up at the bottom of the harbor," added Abe.

 "At least you won\'t have to worry about no goddamned pension or
 health benefits," Nick

said.

"It's the only goddamned job in the world where you can say no to your
boss and get away with it," Abe said, pretending to talk into a phone:
"'Hey Vinny, I need you to take care of someone Tuesday.' 'Tuesday? No,
sorry boss; I got plans.' 'Oh, OK. How about Wednesday?' 'My nephew's
visiting and we're going to the ballgame.' 'Hmm. Thursday?' 'Sorry boss:
in the morning I got a dentist appointment, then I'm playing golf if the
weather's good.' 'Friday?' 'Yeah, Friday works.'"

"I should try that with Phil," I said, mimicking Abe. "Hey Alex, I need
you to dig a trench this morning. Sorry boss, I got plans."

"So, how'd you say no and friggin' live to tell it?" Walter asked.

"I told him about my inventions, and that I'll be striking it rich."

I spat out my coffee, joining the laughter. "You actually said that?"

"That's almost as funny as Morgan wanting to be AFL-CIO president," Abe
said, trying to contain his laughter. "Christ, I'll bet my last paycheck
that five years from now you two clowns will still be here, slaving away
like the rest us."

I rose, slurped what was left of my coffee and tossed the empty cup at
Abe. "Five years from now I *will* be District president and five years
later I *will* be ALF-CIO president. Then I'll make your sorry asses
miserable."

"Five years from now we'll all be retired," said Abe, pointing to Walter
and Gary.

"Then, I'll just have to make it in four." I headed toward the aluminum
ladder, giving everyone a polite over-the-shoulder finger.
